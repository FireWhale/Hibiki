== Welcome

Welcome to the github for Hibiki (www.hibiki.moe), a Ruby-on-Rails musical database focusing on asian music, specificially jpop, anime music (anison), doujin music (independent japanese music), and vocaloid/utaite songs. If you like any of this music, you're definitely in the right place!

== Features

1. Complete relational database focusing on Artists, Albums, Songs, Source Material, 
   and Organizations. These are supported by additional information such as events, 
   tags, seasons, and album art. 
2. A User system where you can track your collection/wishlist, follow artists or anime 
   you're interested in, and get notified of new releases.
3. Regular updating through website scraping, as well as original content such as
   detailed song information. 

== Why another database?

There are some very good websites already out in the web, such as vgmdb.net, 
the vocaloid wiki, the touhou wiki, and the utaite wiki (and many others). However, all
of those don't quite exactly fit my needs. So I decided to create a relational 
database to keep track of all the artists and music I love.
